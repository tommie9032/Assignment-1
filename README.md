# Calculator Program

This is a simple Java-based program that implements a **calculator**, **Fibonacci sequence generator**, and **array operations**. The program is divided into three files, each serving a specific purpose. The main goal is to provide a modular, user-friendly program with interactive menus.

## **Files**

1. **`UserInput.java`**
   - This file contains methods to handle user input.
   - It includes:
     - Accepting two numbers for basic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
     - Accepting a single number for generating the Fibonacci sequence.
     - Accepting multiple numbers for array operations.

2. **`Calculator.java`**
   - This file implements the logic for various operations:
     - **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
     - **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms.
     - **Array Operations**:
       - Computes the sum of array elements.
       - Calculates the average of array elements.

3. **`Main.java`**
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It provides a **menu-driven interface** for the user:
     - **Option 1**: Perform basic arithmetic operations.
     - **Option 2**: Generate a Fibonacci sequence.
     - **Option 3**: Perform operations on an array (sum and average).
     - **Option 4**: Exit the program.
